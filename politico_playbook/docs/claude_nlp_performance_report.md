    name VARCHAR(255),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    role VARCHAR(255),
    party VARCHAR(50),
    confidence DECIMAL(3,2),
    first_seen DATE,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE entity_activities (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_id INTEGER REFERENCES political_entities(id),
    newsletter_date DATE,
    activity TEXT,
    context TEXT,
    confidence DECIMAL(3,2)
);
```

### API Integration
```python
# Optimized batch processing
class BatchProcessor:
    def process_batch(self, newsletters, max_concurrent=3):
        """Process multiple newsletters with controlled concurrency"""
        return asyncio.run(self._process_concurrent(newsletters, max_concurrent))
