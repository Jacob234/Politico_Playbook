Usually the meetings are only open to each county chairman, state committeeman and committee woman. But today — for the first time — vice chairs, secretaries and treasurers are invited to join in. RPOF also invited hundreds of local, chartered Republican clubs to attend a training about how to use social and digital media to recruit new members.\nRPOF Chair EVAN POWER often tells his members not to become complacent even amid a 1.3 million voter registration advantage.\n“We’re doubling down on local empowerment, providing top-tier training and support from the state level to ensure our grassroots warriors are ready to win,” Power told Playbook in a statement.\nThe characters: Saturday has a lineup of Republican heavyweights, from Gov. RON DESANTIS to Rep. BYRON DONALDS and KC CROSBIE, co-chair of the Republican National Committee. The biggest get of all is White House chief of staff SUSIE WILES, who will be receiving the “Statesman of the Year” award during Saturday evening’s Red Florida Dinner.\nRecently added to the dinner lineup is Trump 2024 campaign co-chair CHRIS LACIVITA and Trump chief pollster TONY FABRIZIO. Having the trio there underscores how much Florida will have to share with state GOPs across the country about what it takes to craft and deliver a winning strategy.\n“We’re charging into the year ahead with focus and momentum, ready to compete and win in local races, state legislative battles, statewide offices, congressional contests, and U.S. Senate seats,\" Power said. \"Republican victory is the mission — and Florida is leading the way.\" \nThe forum topics: Saturday's panels will be on school vouchers and support for veterans. Members of Congress and the Legislature also will be holding panels, with a push to lower property taxes sure to be a lead area of discussion.\nThe intrigue: Another major topic of conversation throughout the weekend will be how the governor has been looking seriously at having the Legislature redraw congressional maps.\nBeyond that, Republicans are feeling elated after Trump urged state Sen. JOE GRUTERS to run for chair of the Republican National Committee — that means an internal battle (at least for now) has been avoided for the state chief financial officer job that DeSantis gave to BLAISE INGOGLIA. Interestingly, both Gruters and the newly minted CFO are each set to take the stage Saturday during the forum.\nAnother Cabinet member the grassroots will be eager to hear from is Agriculture Commissioner WILTON SIMPSON, who's speaking during the day Saturday. ERIN ISAAC, spokesperson for Wilton’s political operation, called him a \"proud leader of the Conservative Revolution that has made the Free State of Florida the envy of the nation and President Trump’s strongest partner in delivering on his promises for the American people.\"\nStill leaving Republicans talking is the governor's race. Right now Donalds is the only major candidate on the Republican side to be running for the office. Does he have it locked down with the grassroots thanks to Trump's endorsement? DeSantis hasn’t decided who he’ll back and his own political future is murky.\nThe GOP audience will be listening extra carefully to comments from state Sen. JAY COLLINS, who's still in the running to be lieutenant governor. (A lot of the chatter about these kinds of things also tends to happen at private receptions throughout the weekend.)\nAttendees will be watching closely for trial balloons. Is anyone seriously considering challenging state Attorney General JAMES UTHMEIER (who's also speaking) for the GOP nomination? Also TBD is that the National Republican Congressional Committee has targeted two House seats to try to flip, so these types of meetings give ambitious pols a platform to get their names out there.\nAttending the Florida Freedom Forum? Playbook will be on the ground Friday and Saturday.

DATELINE TALLAHASSEE ...\n\nSTATE RECORD — “A man convicted of the 1994 killings of his wife and their two children became the ninth person put to death in Florida this year, his death Thursday marking a state record for a single-year execution total since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty decades ago,” reports Curt Anderson of The Associated Press.\nRTO — Florida universities are calling employees who have been working remotely back to the office this fall, putting an end to popular Covid-era workplace policies after probing from the state’s DOGE team.\nSeveral schools, including Florida Atlantic University, the University of Central Florida and the University of Florida, have tightened up on hybrid and at-home working allowances in a shift set to affect scores of employees. \n— Andrew Atterbury\nNEW STATE FOREST — The Department of Environmental Protection announced Thursday it closed the deal on buying 12,243 acres near Panama City for a new state forest. DeSantis and the Cabinet last December approved spending $32.65 million to buy the land along Bear Creek in Bay County from Bear Creek Timber. \n\"When opened, Sandy Creek State Forest will provide new outdoor recreation opportunities for families, sportsmen and nature lovers in Northwest Florida,” Simpson, whose department manages state forests, said in the announcement. Also Thursday, the North Florida Land Trust announced it bought 79 acres near Camp Blanding for preservation.\n— Bruce Ritchie\nDRILLING MEDIATION REJECTED — Florida officials are telling a company that wants to drill for oil along the Apalachicola River that they won't go to mediation over the state's permit denial. Clearwater Land and Mineral last week appealed the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's permit denial, two weeks before a new law took effect banning drilling along the river. But the company also said it was invoking a state law that it claims requires mediation rather than a court fight over the denial. \nOn Thursday, the company asked the state's First District Court of Appeal to delay action on the case. The company included an email from a special counsel to Uthmeier stating that DEP won't go to mediation unless ordered and does not agree to delay the case. Other emails showed a DEP lawyer last week agreed to meet with the company's lawyers to discuss choosing a magistrate to oversee the mediation. DEP did not respond to a request for comment.\n— Bruce Ritchie\nNOTHIN’ — SpaceX is a big deal in Florida, given its critical role in helping NASA send astronauts into orbit. POLITICO’s Sam Ogozalek was curious whether DeSantis and ELON MUSK, the private spaceflight company’s CEO, talk often. He filed a public records request last month with DeSantis’ office seeking any communications between the pair — including emails and text messages — since the beginning of the year. The state recently said it found no responsive documents.\n— Sam Ogozalek\nTODAY — “Flags at the state capitol in Tallahassee will fly at half mast in honor of the pro wrestling star [Hulk Hogan] who died last week,” reports POLITICO’s Gregory Svirnovskiy. “Aug. 1 will also be known as ‘Hulk Hogan Day; in Florida to honor the star, DeSantis said Thursday.”\n\nPENINSULA AND BEYOND\n\nMIAMI ELECTION RULING — The Third District Court of Appeal ruled Thursday that Miami’s election cannot be delayed from November 2025 to November 2026 without voter approval. City commissioners tried to move the election in a 3-2 vote, saying that it was intended to increase voter turnout. But the move also would have given commissioners and Mayor FRANCIS SUAREZ another year in office.\nRepublican mayoral candidate EMILIO GONZÁLEZ sued last month to maintain the election dates and won a lower court battle before winning again on appeal.\n“I served this country for 22 years in the United States Army,” he said following Thursday’s ruling. “I spent my entire career helping to build and defend democracies around the world — and I will never sit back and watch one be dismantled in my own backyard.” \nMiami-Dade Commissioner EILEEN HIGGINS, a Democrat running for mayor, called the decision a “win for democracy and fairness.” She wants voters to have a say on moving the election to even-numbered years.\n“As mayor, I’ll propose shortening the next mayor’s term and putting the question on the 2026 ballot to modernize our democracy without undermining it,” she said.\nThe case may next be appealed to the Florida Supreme Court but the city hasn’t announced its plans.\n\nCAMPAIGN MODE\n\nDemocrat Josh Weil dropped out of the Senate race in Florida on July 31, citing health issues. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nWEIL’S OUT — Senate candidate JOSH WEIL announced Thursday that he was suspending his campaign in to focus on his health. Weil has a serious medical condition called rhabdomyolosis, which can lead to kidney damage.\nWeil — who received a good deal of attention earlier this year after raising $14 million in a House special election — revealed in a statement that he was hospitalized for the condition in 2021 and 2022, and that his symptoms worsened as he was campaigning across the state.\n“After discussion with my family, I have decided to focus on my health first and foremost,” he said. “Florida deserves a U.S. Senator who can fight for them 100 percent of the time. I do not wish to hold that seat if I cannot give them that 100 percent that they deserve.”\nWeil said he had “sadness” about the decision but hoped that bowing out early might lead another progressive to enter the race. No other major Democrat has filed to run so far.\n\nTRANSITION TIME\n\nCOMING ON BOARD — There’s a new deputy chief of staff coming to work for DeSantis. JAMES “JAY” KEITH ARNOLD JR. will join the governor’s office on Aug. 11 where he will oversee several key agencies, including those involved with immigration enforcement. His portfolio will include Military Affairs, the Florida National Guard, Florida State Guard, Florida Highway Patrol and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\nArnold, who has been a U.S. Marine Corps infantry officer, currently works as chief of staff for the Florida State Guard.\n“His service at the Florida State Guard has been instrumental to its success and we are confident he will help lead our law enforcement agencies with an experienced hand,” JASON WEIDA, the governor’s chief of staff, said in a statement.\n— Gary Fineout\n\nODDS, ENDS AND FLORIDA MEN\n\nBIRTHDAYS: Former state Rep.
