# Simplified Proof of Concept: Politico Playbook Extraction Tool

## 1. Project Overview

A streamlined proof-of-concept application that extracts structured data from Politico Playbook newsletters, focusing on political relationships, personnel changes, and events.

## 2. Data Collection

### Tools & Technologies:
- **Email client** (Gmail or similar) for newsletter subscription
- **Python** as the primary programming language
- **BeautifulSoup** or **requests-html** for HTML parsing
- **CSV files** for simple data storage during the POC phase

### Concepts:
- Basic HTML parsing
- Email processing
- Text extraction

### Implementation Steps:
1. Subscribe to Politico Playbook newsletter
2. Set up automated email forwarding to ensure collection
3. Create a simple script to extract text content from emails
4. Store raw newsletter text in CSV files with dates

## 3. Text Processing & Information Extraction

### Tools & Technologies:
- **spaCy** - Open-source NLP library with pre-trained models
- **NLTK** - Natural Language Toolkit for text processing
- **Hugging Face Transformers** - For pre-trained NER models
- **Regular expressions** for pattern matching

### Concepts:
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Dependency parsing
- Pattern matching

### Implementation Steps:
1. Preprocess the text (tokenization, sentence splitting)
2. Use spaCy's pre-trained NER to identify people, organizations, and locations
3. Extend NER capabilities with custom training for political entities
4. Implement pattern recognition for common formats:
   - "X was named to Y position"
   - "X was seen with Y at Z"
   - "X is leaving position Y"
   - "X will appear on Y show"

## 4. Relationship & Event Extraction

### Tools & Technologies:
- **spaCy's dependency parser** for relationship extraction
- **Rule-based system** using Python dictionaries/lists
- **Simple classification** using scikit-learn

### Concepts:
- Subject-verb-object extraction
- Relationship classification
- Event categorization

### Implementation Steps:
1. Create rules to identify relationships between entities
2. Build patterns for common Washington interactions
3. Develop simple classifiers for event types:
   - Appointments/hires
   - Departures/firings
   - Sightings/social events
   - Media appearances

## 5. Data Storage

### Tools & Technologies:
- **SQLite** for simple relational storage during POC
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **JSON** for data interchange

### Concepts:
- Basic database schema design
- Entity-relationship modeling

### Implementation Steps:
1. Create simple database schema with tables for:
   - Entities (people, organizations)
   - Relationships
   - Events
   - Sources (linking back to original newsletters)
2. Implement basic CRUD operations
3. Design simple queries for data retrieval

## 6. Simple User Interface

### Tools & Technologies:
- **Flask** or **Streamlit** for web interface
- **NetworkX** for relationship graphs
- **Matplotlib** or **Plotly** for visualization
- **Bootstrap** for basic styling

### Concepts:
- Basic web development
- Data visualization
- Graph representation

### Implementation Steps:
1. Create simple search interface for entities and relationships
2. Implement basic network visualization of relationships
3. Build timeline view for career trajectories
4. Add simple filtering capabilities

## 7. Proof of Concept Evaluation

### Tools & Technologies:
- **Manual verification** against newsletter content
- Simple **accuracy metrics** (precision/recall)

### Concepts:
- Evaluation methodology
- Error analysis

### Implementation Steps:
1. Select sample newsletters for testing
2. Manually verify extraction accuracy
3. Identify common error patterns
4. Document strengths and limitations
